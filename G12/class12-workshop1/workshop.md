# Angular Firebase Workshop

## Goals

- The goal of this workshop is to have a working ui connected with a firebase project that uses angular fire and connnects to an authentication firebase service and firestore database

- The topic of the ui is up to the student, you can make a website themed by the studwent, the only thing that are mandatory are the technical requirements of the project

- The things the projct should have is:

  1. Working login/register/logout functionality so that only authorized users can have access to the data
  2. CRUD Operators for a collection created in firestore, the specifics of the endpoints and what the data is supposed to loook like is up to the student.

- How this projecti is supposed to be built is to start with the frontend and then later add the firebase functionality.

## Tips

- Use rxjs as much as possible and practice with behavioral subjects.
- Before connecting with firebase feel free to use mockdata to build and test the ui
- Reference the code that we have typed on class so far if you get stuck
- Go step by step
- The final website should not have full css implementation as that is not the main focus of this workshop rather the focus should be on writing and practicing angular and then connecting that with a proper firebase project using angular fire.
