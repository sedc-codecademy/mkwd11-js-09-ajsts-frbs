# Introduction to Angular and Data Binding

## What is Angular? 
Angular is a JavaScript framework that enables building reactive single page applications.
Reactive applications are built on top of components that communicate asynchronously as they react to user and system events. As a result, they become scalable, responsive, and fault-tolerant.
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.
An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown  instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
### Angular versioning: 
- Angular 1 or AngularJS, written in plain, vanilla JavaScript
- Angular 2 – Angular 16 (known as Angular 2), written in typescript

There is a clear release schedule and every 6 months the Angular team releases new version of Angular which is basically the same framework with small incremental changes and improvements.
Angular is backward compatible. This means that newer versions of Angular are compatible and able to work with older versions of Angular. This does not apply to AngularJS (Angular 1).

### Angular CLI
Angular CLI is detailed as "A command line interface for Angular".
A command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.
Angular CLI is the recommended and the best way of building Angular projects and applications. To make angular run in the browser a couple of files need to be converted and the CLI does all of that for us. It also heavily optimizes the code. 
One additional tool that we need to make Angular work is Node.js. Why do we need Node.js? Node will be used behind the scenes by the CLI to build, bundle and optimize our angular code with all its dependencies. 

### Installing Node.js and Angular
- Install node.js from the official website: [Node.js website](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/) 
- Install npm: ` npm install -g npm `
- Install angular cli: ` (sudo – for mac and linux) npm install -g @angular/cli@latest `

### Checking versions
` node -v `
` npm -v `
` ng version `

### Creating angular project
Navigate to the folder where you want to create your project and run this commands:
` ng new my-first-app ` (shouldn’t contain whitespaces and shouldn’t contain the word "test")
` cd my-first-app `
` ng serve `

### Structure of the Angular project
#### Root level
- The **package.json** file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version, and dependencies. The file provides the npm package manager with various information to help identify the project and handle dependencies.
- The **package-lock.json** is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed.
It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.
- The **tsconfig.json** file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. The existence of this file in a project specifies that the given directory is the TypeScript project folder root. 
- The **angular.json** file at the root level of an Angular workspace provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults for build and development tools provided by the Angular CLI.

#### The e2e folder 
Contains settings needed for end-to-end testing. 

#### The src folder 
Contains the source for our application code.

- The **styles.css** enables us to set up global project styles that can apply to the overall project.
- The **polyfills.ts** file contains bunch of scripts to implement features that are not supported by the current browser. Angular is built on the latest standards of the web platform. Targeting such a wide range of browsers is challenging because they do not support all features of modern browsers. You compensate by loading polyfill scripts ("polyfills") for the browsers that you must support.

#### The app folder 
The main folder that contains the application code.

#### The assets folder 
Contains our application assets like media, images, icons etc.

#### The environments folder 
Contains config files for different environments like development, production, staging etc.

## DATA BINDING IN ANGULAR
Data binding is a technique where the data stays in sync between the component and the view. Whenever the user updates the data in the view, Angular updates the component. When the component gets new data, the Angular updates the view.
Data binding automatically keeps your page up-to-date based on your application's state. You use data binding to specify things such as the source of an image, the state of a button, or data for a particular user.

### Binding targets
The target of a data binding can be a property, an event, or an attribute name. Every public member of a source directive is automatically available for binding in a template expression or statement.

## Types of data binding
**String interpolation Binding** - This technique displays the component property with their view templates. It uses double curly braces to wrap up the content of the code. It refers to the expressions inserted into the text. 
The double curly braces are referred to as delimiters. In the syntax of the interpolation binding, the displayed property within the view template is covered in curly braces known as the mustache syntax.

**Property binding** - Property binding is one of the binding techniques used to set values for different properties of all the HTML directives and other elements. Property binding is a technique to implement different functionalities such as a toggle button, setting paths, and sharing values. It is an exclusive one-way data binding where the properties of any DOM element are bound with different fields. Property binding has the following syntax- [binding-target] = "binding-source."

**Event binding** - As the name suggests, this approach binds the events with a specific syntax. Its syntax has a target event used within the brackets (). It handles all the events created by a user and calls specific functions as per the necessity.The above techniques are all representation of ONE-WAY data binding. But in Angular a TWO-WAY data binding is also possible.

**Two-way data binding** - Is technique in which the data flows to and back from the component. Whenever a developer changes within the view model, the changes are reflected immediately within the element. The two-way binding in Angular is handy in forms. Any changes made in the user field, the changes are then updated in the model. On the other hand, when a user updates the details in the model, they are reflected within the views component. It has a syntax enclosed within the [()].
